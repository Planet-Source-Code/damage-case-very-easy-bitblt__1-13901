### Description

BitBlt is an API sub routine for painting graphics on a control that has a DC (Device Context). It's fast, flickerless, and used for 2D motion in most VB games. I wrote this for my cousin since he didn't understand BitBlt, he suggested I post it. (Like there aren't a million other BitBlt examples, this one is heavily commented though).
